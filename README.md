# ExamPal

## Introduction
A web app to help the students, especially for the visually challenged students who can't use the online exam portals without any assistance.
<br>



## About this project
This project is submitted to [RuHacks 2021](https://ruhacks.com/) held on May 01-02-2021.
<br>



## Inspiration
During June of Last year, we came across a news article that explained how visually impaired students are struggling to find scribes during the Covid 19 pandemic. We were completely heart broken on knowing their struggle. So, we all decided on the same day to build something that enables visually impaired students to write exams on their own.<br>

<br>


## What it does
- **First, a user is asked to signup as a teacher or as a student**

- **A teacher can create exams with questions and assign a particular start date and time, due date and time, the exam duration, guidelines and assign it to a particular student/students.**

- **The student can then login and take the assigned exams**

- **Here comes the MVP of our project, we have implemented Speech Synthesis for Audio Response and Speech Recognition for giving inputs**

- **When have selected  ```Push to Talk``` find in many modern applications, to start and stop voice recognition.  We chose ```ESC``` Key as it is the top left key on the keyboard and is mostly separated from the rest of the keys in most of the keyboards, students can easily find the ```ESC``` Key without any hassle.** 
- **The complete examination can be taken via simple Voice Commands, can receive responses as audio, making it possible for Visually Impaired students to take exams without difficulties.**

- **Once the examination's duration is over or manually submitted by the student, his/her marks is read out using Speech Synthesis, so they can know their performance in real time.**
<br>


## Tech Stack used
- **Frontend was built using HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery.**

- **Backend was built with [Laravel (PHP)](https://laravel.com) and MYSQL.**

- **Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis were done using Web Speech API.**
<br>


## Problems We Faced
- **Implementing Web Speech API was a bit difficult.**

- **The voice controlled examination system took a lot time to make it work properly.**

- **Maintaining sync between HTML transition and Voice Synthesis in Exam page was hard.**

- **This is our first hackathon, so we faced a lot of hurdles while making the presentation video.**
<br>


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **We are proud of working on stuff that we don't have much of prior experience with.**

- **We also managed to make the website fully functional, in a given short span of time.**

- **We are proud of implementing the Web Speech API, an API that is built in on modern day browsers, but not used much and doesn't have good resources or docs.**
<br>


## What we learnt
**```   The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step   ```**
- **This is our first ever Hackathon, so we had the opportunity of learning a lot of new tips, tricks, tools and stuff.**

- **We learned to work as  a team and collaborate, assigning tasks and dead lines to each other.**

- **We learned to work on new technologies and APIs like Web Speech API.**

- **We also learnt on how to integrate and stich up each one's individual work and make it as a whole functional thing.**
<br>


## What's next for ExamPal
- **Our first goal is to add a more variety of questions that teachers can use while creating exams.**

- **We are planning to implement Face Recognition for authorization.**

- **Combined with Face Recognition, we are also going to make the site fully navigatable through voice so any user can use the site without assistance.**

- **At last we are going to maintain ExamPal as an Open Source project, so everyone can contribute and use it without any extra cost.**

- **Our dream of deploying ExamPal in a production environment will become true soon xD.**
